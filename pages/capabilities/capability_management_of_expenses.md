**Expense Management**

The Expense Management manages one-time or repeated expenses that can be scheduled. Expenses can be categorised into several categories (labeled). The categories can be removed or be attached. Moreover, the expenses can also trigger an reminder to remind the user of upcoming expenses in order to warn him/her. An expense is also attached to one or more Bank accounts. Also an expense can be a transferal from one to another bank account, which allows the user to create one-time or scheduled money transfers between accounts.

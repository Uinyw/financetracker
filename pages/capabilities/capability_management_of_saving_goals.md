**Saving Goals Management**

In order to create saving goals or not drop under a certain amount of money, the Saving Goals Management can keep track of every account. It tracks how much money was used in which category and also how much can still be spend. It is also able to send notifications to the user in order to remind him/her of the spending habbits according to the goals. The goals can be added or removed for every category, group of categories or money in general.

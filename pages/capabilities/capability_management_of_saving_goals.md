# Capability Management of Savings Goals

A user can manage their saving goals in FinanceTracker.
They can add, edit and delete saving goals and display an saving goals overview.
They can categorize saving goals into fixed-term and long-term saving goals.
They can define virtual bank account actions.
A user can view the current status of their savings goal and all statuses for previous periods.
This helps them track whether it will be achieved.
If a user has saved too little in past periods, the savings rate is changed for future periods.

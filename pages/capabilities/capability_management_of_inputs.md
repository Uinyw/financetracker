# Management of Inputs

The Input manager allows the user to input date from various sources. One input method would be the camera. By taking pictures with the camera, the information of the bill is directly being transformed into billing entries.

Another Input method is the Excel list. By Importing data using an excel list the billing entries are created automatically, also a excel list can be exported.

The third method for data input is the API, the API allows developers to attach their own programs to the FinanceTracker and exchange data.

Lastly there also exists a manual option, the manual option allows the user to type in the data manually for every entry/expense, however the bank accounts are not created or edited via this feature.

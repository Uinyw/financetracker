# Capability Analytics

`Analytics` provides a user with the ability to generate data reports that show how much they have earned and spent in a given time period for a specific account.

It also offers a `Predication` feature that predicts the next expenses and how much money needs to be saved for them.
In addition, the predication feature can also track how much is spent in each category.

Another feature is `Pattern & Trends`.
This feature shows current budgeting patterns, how much money is being saved, how much is being spent and also for which product category.
It also shows the savings rate.

The `ImprovementAnalyst` gives recommendations on where a user can save the most money.
It also provides the ability to track goals such as "I want to stay within my monthly budget".

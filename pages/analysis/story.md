# Story [Lachenicht, KÃ¤ssmann]

Lars is a KIT student who recently moved out of his parent's house and into his first apartment of his own.
To prevent losing control of his financial situation, he wants to track and manage his personal finances.
A fellow student recommends the web application _financetracker_, which Lars immediately starts using.

First, Lars provides _financetracker_ with information about his current financial resources.
Lars owns two **bank accounts**, one is a savings account and one is his checking account he uses for his daily expenses.

Second, Lars provides _financetracker_ with information about his **income sources**.
Lars works as a waiter on the side, has a scholarship, and is financially supported by his parents.
While his parents pay him a fixed amount per month and the scholarship a fixed amount per quarter, his remuneration in his part-time job depends on the number of hours he works in the current month.

Third, Lars provides _financetracker_ with information about his **expenses**.
Lars pays monthly rent, quarterly broadcasting fees, and semester fees every six months.
Lars also spends different amounts of money each month on **products** like food, clothes, and books.
With the help of _financetracker_, Lars can manage the products he buys and generate shopping carts.

Lars now sees an overview of his finances, including how much money he currently has in his bank accounts and how much money he earns and spends.

Lars would like to go on vacation in six months.
He creates a periodical **savings goal** for this in _financetracker_.
_Financetracker_ now transfers money from his checking account to his savings account every month for the following six months.
Lars wants to prevent his checking bank account from falling below a certain amount.
To do this, he creates a corresponding rule-based savings goal.

With _financetracker_, Lars sees how much money he accumulated over the last months/years and what predicted expenses will be coming in the next months.
Seeing his predicted future expenses, Lars wants to further optimize his spending behavior.
_Financetracker_ provides a tool for **analyzing** spending habits and creating a budget for each variable expense.
Lars is also shown how many calories he has consumed in the last few months through the products he has purchased and consumed.

Lars wants to impress his parents with his financial discipline.
To do this, he creates a financial report about his tracked expenses and income with _financetracker_.
The report offers insights into spending patterns, income trends, and overall financial health.
The report is in Excel format.

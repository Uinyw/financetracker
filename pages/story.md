## Story [Lachenicht]

Lars is a KIT student who recently moved out of his parents' house and into his first apartment of his own.
To prevent losing control of his financial situation, he wants to track and manage his personal finances.
A fellow student recommends the app FinanceTracker, which Lars installs and opens on his mobile phone.

First, Lars provides FinanceTracker with information about his income sources.
Lars works as a waiter on the side, has a scholarship and is financially supported by his parents.
While his parents pay him a fixed amount per month and the scholarship a fixed amount per quarter, his remuneration in his part-time job depends on the number of hours he works in the current month.

Second, Lars provides FinanceTracker with information about his fixed expenses.
Lars pays monthly rent, quarterly broadcasting fees and semester fees every six months.
FinanceTracker allows him to categorize his fixed expenses.

Third, Lars provides FinanceTracker with information about his variable expenses.
Lars spends different amounts of money each month on food, clothes, books and going to the movies.
FinanceTracker allows him to categorize his variable expenses.

As Lars wants to reduce his expenses, he sets a budget for each variable expense that he would like to spend.
Over the following months, Lars enters each expense in the corresponding category.
FinanceTracker informs hom constantly if he stays within his financial limits.

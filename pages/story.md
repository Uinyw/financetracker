## Story [Lachenicht]

Lars is a KIT student who recently moved out of his parents' house and into his first apartment of his own.
To prevent losing control of his financial situation, he wants to track and manage his personal finances.
A fellow student recommends the app FinanceTracker, which Lars installs and opens on his mobile phone.

First, Lars provides FinanceTracker with information about his income sources.
Lars works as a waiter on the side, has a scholarship and is financially supported by his parents.
While his parents pay him a fixed amount per month and the scholarship a fixed amount per quarter, his remuneration in his part-time job depends on the number of hours he works in the current month.

Second, Lars provides FinanceTracker with information about his fixed expenses.
Lars pays monthly rent, quarterly broadcasting fees and semester fees every six months.
FinanceTracker allows him to categorize his fixed expenses.
Lars can set up reminders for his fixed expenses, ensuring he never misses a payment deadline.

Third, Lars provides FinanceTracker with information about his variable expenses.
Lars spends different amounts of money each month on food, clothes, books and going to the movies.
FinanceTracker allows him to categorize his variable expenses.

As Lars wants to reduce his expenses, he sets a budget for each variable expense that he would like to spend.
Over the following months, Lars enters each expense in the corresponding category.
FinanceTracker informs him constantly if he stays within his financial limits and provides insights into his expense behavior over time.

Lars would like to go on vacation in six months.
He creates a savings goal for this in FinanceTracker.
FinanceTracker tells him how much he needs to save each month to achieve his goal.
FinanceTracker also tracks if his expenses in the next months are in limits for his savings goal.
Lars also wants to save money.
He sets up a long-term savings goal for this. 

Lars wants to impress his parents with his savings discipline.
To do this, he creates a financial report about his tracked expenses and incomes with FinanceTracker.
The report offers insights into spending patterns, income trends, and overall financial health.

Lars wants to optimize his spending behavior. 
FinanceTracker provides a tool for analyzing spending habits, showing Lars where he might be overspending and suggesting areas for improvement.

Lars' financial information is confidential.
Therefore FinanceTracker prioritizes security and privacy, ensuring that his information is secure.
This includes using encryption and other security measures to protect his data.
